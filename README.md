# nbody-2d
A simple N-body simulation implementing Newtonian gravity on a 2D field of dynamically colored particles.

## Usage
- **Left Mouse Button** - toggles attraction towards cursor.  
- **Right Mouse Button** - places a static gravity point that particles are attracted to.  
- **Delete** - removes all gravity points.  
- **R** - resets all particles to their initial positions.  
- **Enter** - sets velocity of all particles to 0, but keeps them in the same spot.  
- **Space Bar** - pauses the simulation.  
- **Esc** - closes the program.
